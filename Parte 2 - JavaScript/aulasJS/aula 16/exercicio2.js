You thought you knew
Deserts your fight
I'll go with you
You're facing down
A dark hall
I'll grab my light
And go with you
I'll go with you
I'll go with you
I'll go with you
I'll go with you
I'll go with you
I'll go with you
I'll go with you
Surrounded and
Up against a wall
I'll shred them all
And go with you
When choices end
You must defend
I'll grab my bat
And go with you
I'll go with you
I'll go with you
I'll go with you, yeah
Stay with me
No, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood
You don't need to run
Stay with me
No, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood
You don't need to run
If there comes a day
People posted up at the end of your driveway
They're calling for your head and they're calling for your name
I'll bomb down on them, I'm coming through
Do they know I was grown with you?
If they're here to smoke, know I'll go with you
Just keep it outside, keep it outside, yeah
Stay with me
No, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood
You don't need to run
Stay with me
No, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood
You don't need to run
You don't need to run
You don't need to run
You don't need to run
You don't need to run
If you find yourself
In a lion's den
I'll jump right in
And pull my pin
And go with you
I'll go with you
I'll go with you
I'll go with you (you don't need to run)
I'll go with you
I'll go with you (you don't need to run)
I'll go with you
My blood, I'll go with you, yeah
Stay with me
No, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood
You don't need to run
Stay with me
No, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood
You don't need to run
You don't need to run
You don't need to run
You don't need to run
You don't need to run
Stay with me
No, you don't need to run
Stay with me, my blood`
